Hi! I am Chenghao Zhang, I am currently a Ph.D. student at Department of Physics, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC), advised by Prof. [Martin Gruebele](https://gruebele-group.chemistry.illinois.edu/). I also benefit from collaboration with Prof. [Peter Wolynes](https://wolynes.rice.edu/) at Rice University.

As a physicist by training, I got my physics undergraduate degree from Peking University, Beijing, China. In my undergraduate study, I worked on nonequilibrium statistical physics and biophysics with Prof. [Yuhai Tu](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-yuhai) and Prof. [Qi Ouyang](http://www.cls.edu.cn/english/PrincipalInvestigator/pi/index1642.shtml). Now I am working at the interface of chemistry and physics. I am interested at studying intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution, quantum scrambling and quantum localization in complex chemical systems, and chemical dynamics in nonadiabatic systems and in condensed phase systems.
