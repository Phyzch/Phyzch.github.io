Vibrational energy flow in molecules, like the dynamics of other many dimensional finite systems, involves quantum transport across a dense network of
near resonant states. For molecules in their electronic
ground state, the network is ordinarily provided by anharmonic vibrational Fermi resonances. Surface crossing
between different electronic states provides another route
to chaotic motion and energy redistribution. We show
that nonadiabatic coupling between electronic energy surfaces facilitates vibrational energy flow, and conversely,
anharmonic vibrational couplings facilitate nonadiabatic
electronic state mixing. A generalization of the LoganWolynes theory of quantum energy flow in many-dimensional Fermi resonance systems to the two-surface case gives a
phase diagram describing the boundary between localized quantum dynamics and global energy flow. We explore these predictions and test them using a model inspired by the problem of electronic excitation energy transfer in the photosynthetic
reaction center. Using an explicit numerical solution of the time dependent Schrodinger equation for this ten-dimensional Â¨
model, we find quite good agreement with the expectations from the approximate analytical theory.
